# Neoleads Application

There is README file in every app internal folder for proper folder and file struture. You need to read them also.

## Introduction

Welcome to [Project Name]! This document outlines our project structure, coding standards, and best practices. It's crucial that everyone contributing to the project adheres to these guidelines to maintain code consistency and quality.

## Project Structure

Our project follows a specific folder and file structure to ensure ease of navigation and maintenance. Please familiarize yourself with this structure and adhere to it when contributing.

project-root (app)
|-- /pages # Page components, each file corresponds to a route
|-- /components # Reusable React components
|-- /services # Business logic and service layer, including Firestore interactions
|-- /models # Data model definitions, Firestore document structures, TypeScript interfaces
|-- /hooks # Custom React hooks
|-- /context # React Context API providers and consumers (Not Recommended use redux)
|-- /lib # Utility functions and libraries
|-- /public # Static files like images, fonts
|-- /styles # CSS or styling files
|-- /config # Configuration files, environment variable management
|-- /tests # Test files
|-- /store # State management (Redux, Zustand, etc.)
|-- /api # Next.js API routes for server-side logic
|-- /scripts # Custom scripts for development, database seeding, deployment
|-- /docs # Project documentation

## Coding Standards

1. **Consistency**: Adhere to the established coding styles. Use ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting.
2. **Modularization**: Keep components and functions small, manageable, and reusable.
3. **Commenting**: Document complex logic for better understanding and maintainability.
4. **Testing**: Write tests for your code (unit, integration, end-to-end).
5. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling, especially in service layers.
6. **Performance**: Optimize for performance; use React best practices.
7. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript for type safety wherever applicable.
8. **Version Control**: Use clear commit messages, branch names, and pull requests.
9. **CI/CD**: Follow the CI/CD pipeline process for testing and deployment.

## Workflow

1. **Branching**: For new features, branch off from `develop`. Name your branches as `feature/your-feature`.
2. **Pull Requests**: When a feature is complete, create a pull request against `develop`.
3. **Code Reviews**: Ensure your code is reviewed by at least one other developer before merging.
4. **Testing**: Run tests locally before pushing your code.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
- Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn`
- Start the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
- Build for production: `npm run build` or `yarn build`
