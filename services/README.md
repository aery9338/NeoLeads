# Services Structure in [Project Name]

## Overview

This document provides a detailed overview of the `services` directory structure in our project. The `services` layer is crucial as it handles business logic, API calls, data processing, and interactions with external services.

## Services Directory Structure

The `services` directory is organized to ensure modularity, reusability, and maintainability of our business logic. Here's the structure and description of each subdirectory:

/src
|-- /services
|-- /api # Functions for API calls
|-- /auth # Authentication related services
|-- /data # Data manipulation and processing services
|-- /hooks # Service-related custom hooks
|-- /utils # Utility functions specific to services
|-- /validation # Data validation logic
|-- index.js # Barrel file for services

### Detailed Description

- **`/api`**: Contains functions and utilities to interact with external APIs. It includes wrappers around `fetch` or `axios` for making HTTP requests.

- **`/auth`**: Manages authentication logic, including login, logout, and user session management.

- **`/data`**: Handles data processing tasks, such as transforming API responses, managing local caches, and preparing data for UI components.

- **`/hooks`**: Custom React hooks that encapsulate service-related logic, making them reusable across components.

- **`/utils`**: Utility functions that support service operations, such as error handling, API response parsing, and other helper functions.

- **`/validation`**: Contains logic for validating data, such as form inputs or API request payloads.

- **`index.js`**: A barrel file that exports all services, allowing for simplified imports within the application.

## Best Practices

- **Modularity**: Keep service functions small and focused. Break down complex tasks into smaller functions.

- **Reusability**: Design service functions to be reusable across different parts of the application.

- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling within service functions to manage API errors gracefully.

- **Testing**: Write unit tests for service functions to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## Contribution

When contributing to the `services` directory, please ensure your code adheres to the established patterns and best practices. For adding new services or modifying existing ones, consider the overall architecture and discuss with the team if necessary.

## Getting Started

To use a service in your component:

```javascript
import { useMyCustomHook } from "src/services/hooks";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const data = useMyCustomHook();
  // Component logic
};
```
