# Models Structure in [Project Name]

## Overview

This document outlines the structure and organization of the `models` directory in our project. The `models` directory is critical for defining the shape of data within the application, including interfaces, types, and classes, especially in TypeScript-based projects.

## Models Directory Structure

Our `models` directory is structured to provide clear and maintainable data definitions. Below is the structure with a description for each subdirectory:

/src
|-- /models
|-- /common # Shared or generic type definitions
|-- /domain # Domain-specific models
|-- /api # Models related to API responses
|-- /form # Form data structures
|-- index.ts # Barrel file for models

### Detailed Description

- **`/common`**: Contains generic type definitions and interfaces used across the application, such as utility types, common enums, etc.

- **`/domain`**: Domain-specific models, representing the core business logic and entities of your application (e.g., User, Product, Order).

- **`/api`**: Types or interfaces that correspond to API request and response structures, ensuring that data received from and sent to the backend matches expected schemas.

- **`/form`**: Structures related to form data, including form state types, validation schemas (if using libraries like Yup), and interface definitions for form fields.

- **`index.ts`**: A barrel file that aggregates and exports all models, allowing for simplified imports throughout the application.

## Best Practices

- **Consistency**: Use consistent naming conventions and patterns for type definitions and interfaces.

- **Modularity**: Define types and interfaces in a modular way, ensuring each model is focused and not overly complex.

- **Reusability**: Design models to be reusable where applicable, to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.

- **Documentation**: Document complex types or interfaces for better understanding and maintainability.

## Contribution

When contributing to the `models` directory, please adhere to the established patterns and ensure your data structures are well thought out and discussed with the team, if necessary.

## Usage Example

To use a model in your component or service:

```typescript
import { User } from "src/models/domain";

const userProfile: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
};
```
