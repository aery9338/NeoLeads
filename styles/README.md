# Styles Structure in [Project Name]

## Overview

This document outlines the organization of the `styles` directory in our project. The `styles` directory contains all the CSS, SCSS, or styled-components used to style our React application, ensuring a consistent and maintainable approach to styling across the app.

## Styles Directory Structure

The `styles` directory is structured to facilitate ease of use, scalability, and maintainability. Here's the structure with a description of each subdirectory:

/src
|-- /styles
|-- /base # Base styles, resets, and common rules
|-- /components # Styles specific to components
|-- /pages # Page-specific styles
|-- /themes # Theming related styles
|-- /utils # Utility classes, mixins, and functions
|-- globals.css # Global styles

### Detailed Description

- **`/base`**: Contains foundational styles such as resets, typography rules, and other base elements that are common throughout the application.

- **`/components`**: Styles that are specific to individual components. Ideally, each styled component should have a corresponding file here.

- **`/pages`**: Contains styles that are specific to individual pages. This helps in managing styles that are unique to a single page.

- **`/themes`**: If theming is used (like dark mode), this directory will include theme definitions and style variables that can be switched.

- **`/utils`**: Utility classes, SASS/SCSS mixins, and functions that are reused across different stylesheets.

- **`globals.css`**: A global stylesheet for styles that need to be applied globally across the application.

## Best Practices

- **Modularity**: Keep styles modular and aligned with the component structure. Avoid large, monolithic stylesheets.

- **Scalability**: Use a scalable naming convention like BEM, SMACSS, or OOCSS to avoid conflicts and ensure readability.

- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent theming and styling across the application. Utilize variables for colors, fonts, and other reusable properties.

- **Performance**: Be mindful of the performance implications of CSS, especially with respect to layout reflows, repaints, and specificity wars.

## Contribution

When contributing to the `styles` directory, ensure your styles adhere to the established patterns and guidelines. Review your styles for consistency and performance implications.

## Usage Example

To include a style in your component:

```javascript
import "./styles/components/myComponent.css";

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div className="myComponent">...</div>;
};
```
